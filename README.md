# DTFF2022_Final_Test



## Deadline 

*2022-12-19* 



## To Do List based on Requirements and Literature 

1. Single repository on GitHub, all group members as controbutor 

check contributors 

2. Neatly and concisely structure 

use Cookiecutter 

3. Keep working on it consistently, avoid bulk commits

use test repo first, officially commit maybe once a week 

4. Create well-documented database, with update methods

use Docker to manage database would have extra bonus 

5. Design figures and tables, with visualization standards discussed in class

class to be taken 

6. Short paper using LaTeX or Jupyter/Shiny, populating it with sections, a table of contents, and the above tables and figures 

to be determined how to do 

7. A beamer presentation for project using LaTeX

what is 'beamer presentation'? 

8. One interactive app (Shiny or Jupyter notebook) describing the main finding and presenting several robustness checks

class to be taken 

9. Results are reproducible by ensuring that the coding environment is exported and concise documentation is present

to be determined how to do 



## Official Requirements for Final Project 

(75\%, group assignment, same grade, deadline 19-Dec-2022)

Please submit a little research project adhering to the following requirements:

- make it hosted as a single repository on Github with all group members as contributors;
- structure it neatly and concisely, avoid the clutter of folders and files for which third people have no use (use .gitignore);
- keep working on it consistently, avoid bulk commits;
- create a little well-documented database with the data you use, ideally with update methods;
- design figures and tables to support your findings, keeping them in line with visualization standards discussed in class;
- write a short paper about it using LaTeX or Jupyter/Shiny, populating it with sections, a table of contents, as well as the above tables and figures;
- write a beamer presentation for your project using LaTeX;
- create one interactive app (Shiny or Jupyter notebook) describing the main finding and presenting several robustness checks;
- make sure the results are reproducible by ensuring that the coding environment is exported and concise documentation is present;
- in the ideal case, anyone who could pass this course should be able to see and reproduce your findings from scratch.

You can pick a topic from the [list of suggested topics](./research-topics.md), but own topics are strongly encouraged! You can also choose to replicate a result from a paper (which does not have an open-source implementation yet).
