# DTFF2022_Final_Test

### final

(75\%, group assignment, same grade, deadline 19-Dec-2022)

Please submit a little research project adhering to the following requirements:

- make it hosted as a single repository on Github with all group members as contributors;
- structure it neatly and concisely, avoid the clutter of folders and files for which third people have no use (use .gitignore);
- keep working on it consistently, avoid bulk commits;
- create a little well-documented database with the data you use, ideally with update methods;
- design figures and tables to support your findings, keeping them in line with visualization standards discussed in class;
- write a short paper about it using LaTeX or Jupyter/Shiny, populating it with sections, a table of contents, as well as the above tables and figures;
- write a beamer presentation for your project using LaTeX;
- create one interactive app (Shiny or Jupyter notebook) describing the main finding and presenting several robustness checks;
- make sure the results are reproducible by ensuring that the coding environment is exported and concise documentation is present;
- in the ideal case, anyone who could pass this course should be able to see and reproduce your findings from scratch.

You can pick a topic from the [list of suggested topics](./research-topics.md), but own topics are strongly encouraged! You can also choose to replicate a result from a paper (which does not have an open-source implementation yet).
